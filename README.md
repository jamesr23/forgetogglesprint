# togglesprint for forge version 1.8.9
i made this because i needed a way to easily toggle between having togglesprint enabled and disabled; as in being able to switch between the regular sprinting mechanincs and togglesprint.  
the sprint key is the same  
enable with /togglesprint enable   
disable with /togglesprint disable   
toggle with /togglesprint or /togglesprint toggle  
aliases: /ts  

# installation
to clone the project and build on your own:  
run ./gradlew build in the project root directory  
copy build/libs/togglesprint-1.0.jar to your minecraft runtime/mods folder
